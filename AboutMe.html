    <h1>Jai Lava Kusa</h1>
    <p>
        The film follows identical triplets, Jai, Lava and Kusa, who get separated at a young age and 
        follow different paths in life. Jai becomes an evil criminal, Kusa becomes a small-time crook 
        and Lava becomes a bank manager. Jai, the eldest of identical triplets was sidelined at a very 
        young age due to stammering. I like this movie because it makes me more emotional while watching it.
